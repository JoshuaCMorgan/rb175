# Code Challenge: Users and Interests
The goal is to create a Sinatra application that satisfies these requirements using what's covered so far in the course.

# Requirements

- When a user loads the home page, they should be redirected to a page that lists all of the users' names. Load the users from the users.yaml file (content below).
- Each of the users' names should be a link to a page for that user.
- On each user's page, display their email address. Also display their interests, with a comma appearing between each interest.
- At the bottom of each user's page, list links to all of the other users pages. Do not include the user whose page it is in this list.
- Add a layout to the application. At the bottom of every page, display a message like this: "There are 3 users with a total of 9 interests."
- Update the message printed out in #5 to determine the number of users and interests based on the content of the YAML file. Use a helper method, count_interests, to determine the total number of interests across all users.
- Add a new user to the users.yaml file. Verify that the site updates accordingly.
